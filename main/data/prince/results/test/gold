chapter 4 .
i had thus learned a second fact of great importance : this was that the planet the little prince came from was scarcely any larger than a house !
but that did not really surprise me much .
i knew very well that in addition to the great planets -- such as the earth , jupiter , mars , venus -- to which we have given names , there are also hundreds of others , some of which are so small that one has a hard time seeing them through the telescope .
when an astronomer discovers one of these he does not give it a name , but only a number .
he might call it , for example , " asteroid 325 . "
i have serious reason to believe that the planet from which the little prince came is the asteroid known as b-612 .
this asteroid has only once been seen through the telescope .
that was by a turkish astronomer , in 1909 .
on making his discovery , the astronomer had presented it to the international astronomical congress , in a great demonstration .
but he was in turkish costume , and so nobody would believe what he said .
grown - ups are like that ...
fortunately , however , for the reputation of asteroid b-612 , a turkish dictator made a law that his subjects , under pain of death , should change to european costume .
so in 1920 the astronomer gave his demonstration all over again , dressed with impressive style and elegance .
and this time everybody accepted his report .
if i have told you these details about the asteroid , and made a note of its number for you , it is on account of the grown - ups and their ways .
when you tell them that you have made a new friend , they never ask you any questions about essential matters .
they never say to you , " what does his voice sound like ?
what games does he love best ?
does he collect butterflies ? "
instead , they demand : " how old is he ?
how many brothers has he ?
how much does he weigh ?
how much money does his father make ? "
only from these figures do they think they have learned anything about him .
if you were to say to the grown - ups : " i saw a beautiful house made of rosy brick , with geraniums in the windows and doves on the roof , " they would not be able to get any idea of that house at all .
you would have to say to them : " i saw a house that cost $ 20,000 . "
then they would exclaim : " oh , what a pretty house that is ! "
just so , you might say to them : " the proof that the little prince existed is that he was charming , that he laughed , and that he was looking for a sheep .
if anybody wants a sheep , that is a proof that he exists . "
and what good would it do to tell them that ?
they would shrug their shoulders , and treat you like a child .
but if you said to them : " the planet he came from is asteroid b-612 , " then they would be convinced , and leave you in peace from their questions .
they are like that .
one must not hold it against them .
children should always show great forbearance toward grown - up people .
but certainly , for us who understand life , figures are a matter of indifference .
i should have liked to begin this story in the fashion of the fairy - tales .
i should have like to say : " once upon a time there was a little prince who lived on a planet that was scarcely any bigger than himself , and who had need of a sheep ... "
to those who understand life , that would have given a much greater air of truth to my story .
for i do not want any one to read my book carelessly .
i have suffered too much grief in setting down these memories .
six years have already passed since my friend went away from me , with his sheep .
if i try to describe him here , it is to make sure that i shall not forget him .
to forget a friend is sad .
not every one has had a friend .
and if i forget him , i may become like the grown - ups who are no longer interested in anything but figures ...
it is for that purpose , again , that i have bought a box of paints and some pencils .
it is hard to take up drawing again at my age , when i have never made any pictures except those of the boa constrictor from the outside and the boa constrictor from the inside , since i was six .
i shall certainly try to make my portraits as true to life as possible .
but i am not at all sure of success .
one drawing goes along all right , and another has no resemblance to its subject .
i make some errors , too , in the little prince 's height : in one place he is too tall and in another too short .
and i feel some doubts about the color of his costume .
so i fumble along as best i can , now good , now bad , and i hope generally fair - to - middling .
in certain more important details i shall make mistakes , also .
but that is something that will not be my fault .
my friend never explained anything to me .
he thought , perhaps , that i was like himself .
but i , alas , do not know how to see sheep through the walls of boxes .
perhaps i am a little like the grown - ups .
i have had to grow old .
chapter 5 .
as each day passed i would learn , in our talk , something about the little prince 's planet , his departure from it , his journey .
the information would come very slowly , as it might chance to fall from his thoughts .
it was in this way that i heard , on the third day , about the catastrophe of the baobabs .
this time , once more , i had the sheep to thank for it .
for the little prince asked me abruptly -- as if seized by a grave doubt -- " it is true , is n't it , that sheep eat little bushes ? "
" yes , that is true . "
" ah !
i am glad ! "
i did not understand why it was so important that sheep should eat little bushes .
but the little prince added : " then it follows that they also eat baobabs ? "
i pointed out to the little prince that baobabs were not little bushes , but , on the contrary , trees as big as castles ; and that even if he took a whole herd of elephants away with him , the herd would not eat up one single baobab .
the idea of the herd of elephants made the little prince laugh .
" we would have to put them one on top of the other , " he said .
but he made a wise comment : " before they grow so big , the baobabs start out by being little . "
" that is strictly correct , "
i said .
" but why do you want the sheep to eat the little baobabs ? "
he answered me at once , " oh , come , come ! " , as if he were speaking of something that was self - evident .
and i was obliged to make a great mental effort to solve this problem , without any assistance .
indeed , as i learned , there were on the planet where the little prince lived -- as on all planets -- good plants and bad plants .
in consequence , there were good seeds from good plants , and bad seeds from bad plants .
but seeds are invisible .
they sleep deep in the heart of the earth 's darkness , until some one among them is seized with the desire to awaken .
then this little seed will stretch itself and begin -- timidly at first -- to push a charming little sprig inoffensively upward toward the sun .
if it is only a sprout of radish or the sprig of a rose - bush , one would let it grow wherever it might wish .
but when it is a bad plant , one must destroy it as soon as possible , the very first instant that one recognizes it .
now there were some terrible seeds on the planet that was the home of the little prince ; and these were the seeds of the baobab .
the soil of that planet was infested with them .
a baobab is something you will never , never be able to get rid of if you attend to it too late .
it spreads over the entire planet .
it bores clear through it with its roots .
and if the planet is too small , and the baobabs are too many , they split it in pieces ...
" it is a question of discipline , " the little prince said to me later on .
" when you 've finished your own toilet in the morning , then it is time to attend to the toilet of your planet , just so , with the greatest care .
you must see to it that you pull up regularly all the baobabs , at the very first moment when they can be distinguished from the rosebushes which they resemble so closely in their earliest youth .
it is very tedious work , " the little prince added , " but very easy . "
and one day he said to me : " you ought to make a beautiful drawing , so that the children where you live can see exactly how all this is .
that would be very useful to them if they were to travel some day .
sometimes , " he added , " there is no harm in putting off a piece of work until another day .
but when it is a matter of baobabs , that always means a catastrophe .
i knew a planet that was inhabited by a lazy man .
he neglected three little bushes ... "
so , as the little prince described it to me , i have made a drawing of that planet .
i do not much like to take the tone of a moralist .
but the danger of the baobabs is so little understood , and such considerable risks would be run by anyone who might get lost on an asteroid , that for once i am breaking through my reserve .
" children , "
i say plainly , " watch out for the baobabs ! "
my friends , like myself , have been skirting this danger for a long time , without ever knowing it ; and so it is for them that i have worked so hard over this drawing .
the lesson which i pass on by this means is worth all the trouble it has cost me .
perhaps you will ask me , " why are there no other drawing in this book as magnificent and impressive as this drawing of the baobabs ? "
the reply is simple .
i have tried .
but with the others i have not been successful .
when i made the drawing of the baobabs i was carried beyond myself by the inspiring force of urgent necessity .
chapter 6 .
oh , little prince !
bit by bit i came to understand the secrets of your sad little life ...
for a long time you had found your only entertainment in the quiet pleasure of looking at the sunset .
i learned that new detail on the morning of the fourth day , when you said to me : " i am very fond of sunsets .
come , let us go look at a sunset now . "
" but we must wait , "
i said .
" wait ?
for what ? "
" for the sunset .
we must wait until it is time . "
at first you seemed to be very much surprised .
and then you laughed to yourself .
you said to me : " i am always thinking that i am at home ! "
just so .
everybody knows that when it is noon in the united states the sun is setting over france .
if you could fly to france in one minute , you could go straight into the sunset , right from noon .
unfortunately , france is too far away for that .
but on your tiny planet , my little prince , all you need do is move your chair a few steps .
you can see the day end and the twilight falling whenever you like ...
" one day , " you said to me , " i saw the sunset forty - four times ! "
and a little later you added : " you know -- one loves the sunset , when one is so sad ... "
" were you so sad , then ? "
i asked , " on the day of the forty - four sunsets ? "
but the little prince made no reply .
