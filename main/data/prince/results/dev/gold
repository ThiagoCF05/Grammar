chapter 1 .
once when i was six years old i saw a magnificent picture in a book , called true stories from nature , about the primeval forest .
it was a picture of a boa constrictor in the act of swallowing an animal .
here is a copy of the drawing .
in the book it said : " boa constrictors swallow their prey whole , without chewing it .
after that they are not able to move , and they sleep through the six months that they need for digestion . "
i pondered deeply , then , over the adventures of the jungle .
and after some work with a colored pencil i succeeded in making my first drawing .
my drawing number one .
it looked like this : i showed my masterpiece to the grown - ups , and asked them whether the drawing frightened them .
but they answered : " frighten ?
why should any one be frightened by a hat ? "
my drawing was not a picture of a hat .
it was a picture of a boa constrictor digesting an elephant .
but since the grown - ups were not able to understand it , i made another drawing : i drew the inside of the boa constrictor , so that the grown - ups could see it clearly .
they always need to have things explained .
my drawing number two looked like this : the grown - ups ' response , this time , was to advise me to lay aside my drawings of boa constrictors , whether from the inside or the outside , and devote myself instead to geography , history , arithmetic and grammar .
that is why , at the age of six , i gave up what might have been a magnificent career as a painter .
i had been disheartened by the failure of my drawing number one and my drawing number two .
grown - ups never understand anything by themselves , and it is tiresome for children to be always and forever explaining things to them .
so then i chose another profession , and learned to pilot airplanes .
i have flown a little over all parts of the world ; and it is true that geography has been very useful to me .
at a glance i can distinguish china from arizona .
if one gets lost in the night , such knowledge is valuable .
in the course of this life i have had a great many encounters with a great many people who have been concerned with matters of consequence .
i have lived a great deal among grown - ups .
i have seen them intimately , close at hand .
and that has n't much improved my opinion of them .
whenever i met one of them who seemed to me at all clear - sighted , i tried the experiment of showing him my drawing number one , which i have always kept .
i would try to find out , so , if this was a person of true understanding .
but , whoever it was , he , or she , would always say : " that is a hat . "
then i would never talk to that person about boa constrictors , or primeval forests , or stars .
i would bring myself down to his level .
i would talk to him about bridge , and golf , and politics , and neckties .
and the grown - up would be greatly pleased to have met such a sensible man .
chapter 2 .
so i lived my life alone , without anyone that i could really talk to , until i had an accident with my plane in the desert of sahara , six years ago .
something was broken in my engine .
and as i had with me neither a mechanic nor any passengers , i set myself to attempt the difficult repairs all alone .
it was a question of life or death for me : i had scarcely enough drinking water to last a week .
the first night , then , i went to sleep on the sand , a thousand miles from any human habitation .
i was more isolated than a shipwrecked sailor on a raft in the middle of the ocean .
thus you can imagine my amazement , at sunrise , when i was awakened by an odd little voice .
it said : " if you please -- draw me a sheep ! "
" what ! "
" draw me a sheep ! "
i jumped to my feet , completely thunderstruck .
i blinked my eyes hard .
i looked carefully all around me .
and i saw a most extraordinary small person , who stood there examining me with great seriousness .
here you may see the best portrait that , later , i was able to make of him .
but my drawing is certainly very much less charming than its model .
that , however , is not my fault .
the grown - ups discouraged me in my painter 's career when i was six years old , and i never learned to draw anything , except boas from the outside and boas from the inside .
now i stared at this sudden apparition with my eyes fairly starting out of my head in astonishment .
remember , i had crashed in the desert a thousand miles from any inhabited region .
and yet my little man seemed neither to be straying uncertainly among the sands , nor to be fainting from fatigue or hunger or thirst or fear .
nothing about him gave any suggestion of a child lost in the middle of the desert , a thousand miles from any human habitation .
when at last i was able to speak , i said to him : " but -- what are you doing here ? "
and in answer he repeated , very slowly , as if he were speaking of a matter of great consequence : " if you please -- draw me a sheep ... "
when a mystery is too overpowering , one dare not disobey .
absurd as it might seem to me , a thousand miles from any human habitation and in danger of death , i took out of my pocket a sheet of paper and my fountain - pen .
but then i remembered how my studies had been concentrated on geography , history , arithmetic , and grammar , and i told the little chap ( a little crossly , too ) that i did not know how to draw .
he answered me : " that does n't matter .
draw me a sheep ... "
but i had never drawn a sheep .
so i drew for him one of the two pictures i had drawn so often .
it was that of the boa constrictor from the outside .
and i was astounded to hear the little fellow greet it with , " no , no , no !
i do not want an elephant inside a boa constrictor .
a boa constrictor is a very dangerous creature , and an elephant is very cumbersome .
where i live , everything is very small .
what i need is a sheep .
draw me a sheep . "
so then i made a drawing .
he looked at it carefully , then he said : " no .
this sheep is already very sickly .
make me another . "
so i made another drawing .
my friend smiled gently and indulgently .
" you see yourself , " he said , " that this is not a sheep .
this is a ram .
it has horns . "
so then i did my drawing over once more .
but it was rejected too , just like the others .
" this one is too old .
i want a sheep that will live a long time . "
by this time my patience was exhausted , because i was in a hurry to start taking my engine apart .
so i tossed off this drawing .
and i threw out an explanation with it .
" this is only his box .
the sheep you asked for is inside . "
i was very surprised to see a light break over the face of my young judge : " that is exactly the way i wanted it !
do you think that this sheep will have to have a great deal of grass ? "
" why ? "
" because where i live everything is very small ... "
" there will surely be enough grass for him , "
i said .
" it is a very small sheep that i have given you . "
he bent his head over the drawing : " not so small that -- look !
he has gone to sleep ... "
and that is how i made the acquaintance of the little prince .
chapter 3 .
it took me a long time to learn where he came from .
the little prince , who asked me so many questions , never seemed to hear the ones i asked him .
it was from words dropped by chance that , little by little , everything was revealed to me .
the first time he saw my airplane , for instance ( i shall not draw my airplane ; that would be much too complicated for me ) , he asked me : " what is that object ? "
" that is not an object .
it flies .
it is an airplane .
it is my airplane . "
and i was proud to have him learn that i could fly .
he cried out , then : " what !
you dropped down from the sky ? "
" yes , "
i answered , modestly .
" oh !
that is funny ! "
and the little prince broke into a lovely peal of laughter , which irritated me very much .
i like my misfortunes to be taken seriously .
then he added : " so you , too , come from the sky !
which is your planet ? "
at that moment i caught a gleam of light in the impenetrable mystery of his presence ; and i demanded , abruptly : " do you come from another planet ? "
but he did not reply .
he tossed his head gently , without taking his eyes from my plane : " it is true that on that you can n't have come from very far away ... "
and he sank into a reverie , which lasted a long time .
then , taking my sheep out of his pocket , he buried himself in the contemplation of his treasure .
you can imagine how my curiosity was aroused by this half - confidence about the " other planets . "
i made a great effort , therefore , to find out more on this subject .
" my little man , where do you come from ?
what is this ' where i live , ' of which you speak ?
where do you want to take your sheep ? "
after a reflective silence he answered : " the thing that is so good about the box you have given me is that at night he can use it as his house . "
" that is so .
and if you are good i will give you a string , too , so that you can tie him during the day , and a post to tie him to . "
but the little prince seemed shocked by this offer : " tie him !
what a queer idea ! "
" but if you do n't tie him , "
i said , " he will wander off somewhere , and get lost . "
my friend broke into another peal of laughter : " but where do you think he would go ? "
" anywhere .
straight ahead of him . "
then the little prince said , earnestly : " that does n't matter .
where i live , everything is so small ! "
and , with perhaps a hint of sadness , he added : " straight ahead of him , nobody can go very far ... "
