1. Introduction

This package contains 1053 English discussion forum (DF) and newswire
(NW) sentences and their associated gold standard, manually-generated
AMRs. This data served as the test set for the SemEval-2016 Task 8:
Meaning Representation Parsing task.

The AMRs in this test set were sequestered until after the conclusion
of the SemEval-2016 evaluation, and are being made available to task
participants in this release for post-hoc quality control and analysis
purposes.

3. Data Selection

The data in this release was selected to provide a set of 1000
AMR/English sentence pairs to serve as blind test data for
SemEval-2016 Task 8: Meaning Representation Parsing
<http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2016/task8/>

Relationship to training corpus (LDC2015E86)

To roughly mirror the genre proportions in training data (LDC2015E86 -
which had an approximately 40%/50%/10% DF/NW/other genre split), the
data in this release was selected to provide a 50%/50% DF/NW genre
split for the test set.
